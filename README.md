## Overview
Attendancify is designed for educators and organizations conducting online classes via Zoom. The app automates attendance tracking by processing Zoom session logs, calculating each participant's presence based on their precise session duration. Administrators can set custom time thresholds to specify how much time is needed to be marked presentâ€”ensuring exact and error-free attendance calculation.

Key features:
- *Automatic Attendance Generation*: Instantly creates verified attendance records from Zoom logs, with time criteria customizable by the admin.
- *Second-Level Precision*: Checks each participant's session duration down to the second, eliminating manual calculation errors.
- *Master Sheet Matching Tool*: Cross-matches session attendance with a master student list. Quickly identifies which enrolled students missed the session for easy reporting and compliance.
- *Batch Processing*: Runs on multiple sessions or files efficiently.

This suite streamlines reporting, enhances accuracy, and saves time for instructors and admins managing digital learning environments.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- Flask: Web framework for the application interface
- Pandas: Data processing and analysis of attendance records
- OpenPyXL: Excel file handling for session logs and master lists
- Bootstrap 5: Responsive UI design

4. Submit to cross-match participants with enrolled students.
5. Download the Excel file listing students who were absent from the session.

## File Formats

### Zoom Session Log
- Must be an Excel file (.xlsx)
- Should contain columns for participant names and session duration
- Exported directly from Zoom after a session

### Master Student List
- Must be an Excel file (.xlsx)
- Should contain a column with student names (exact match with Zoom log names)
- Represents the official enrollment list

## Features in Detail
