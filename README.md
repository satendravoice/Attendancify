## Overview
Attendancify is a comprehensive, web-based suite designed to streamline and automate attendance management. Tailored for educators, trainers, and event organizers, it helps transform raw attendance data—especially Zoom meeting logs—into structured, actionable insights with minimal effort. The platform offers fast, reliable, and smart tools for generating, matching, and exporting attendance records.

## Features
Attendancify offers a unified dashboard for efficient access to all essential tools, enabling users to effortlessly navigate core features. The Attendance Generator lets you upload and process multiple Zoom CSV logs, configure session criteria, and automatically produce detailed Excel attendance reports that mark each participant as present or absent. The Raw Excel Generator transforms inconsistent or messy attendance data into standardized, ready-to-analyze formats, making batch processing and clean exports simple. With Attendance Matching, disparate attendance sources are reconciled using intelligent fuzzy name-matching algorithms, ensuring reliable participant tracking. The system is engineered for fast processing of large and complex files through optimized backend routines, while advanced smart matching ensures robust, error-tolerant data correlation. All results are clearly exported into structured Excel reports suitable for academic, corporate, or administrative needs.
